Cowsay, What?!

I worked with Chris Wilson, and Sean Bailey

We pulled in the classic Python Cowsay Utility to push an input that prints the cow to the screen! 

On the homepage - there is an input on the homepage along with a link to the history of the cow.

On the history - there is a list of the previous 10 cows and what they said!
